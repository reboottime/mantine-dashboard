Mantine Dashboard is a responsive admin dashboard template built with Mantine UI library. It provides a set of reusable UI components and page templates that you can use to create your own admin dashboard or web application.

## Features

- Dark and light color schemes
- Modular architecture that allows you to easily customize and extend the template
- A variety of UI components, including charts, tables, forms, and more
- Page templates for dashboard, user profile, settings, and more

## Getting Started

To get started with Mantine Dashboard, you will need to have Node.js and Git installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/reboottime/mantine-dashboard.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

This will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000. You can then open the project in your web browser and begin customizing the template to your needs.

## Customization

Mantine Dashboard is designed to be easily customizable and extendable. You can modify the existing UI components and page templates or create your own components and pages.

To modify the existing components and templates, simply edit the corresponding files in the `src` directory. To create your own components and templates, create a new file in the `src` directory and import it into your app.

## Deployment

To deploy your Mantine Dashboard app to production, you will need to build the project first. To do this, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of your app in the `build` directory. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting service of your choice.
